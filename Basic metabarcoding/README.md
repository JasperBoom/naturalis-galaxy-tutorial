# Basic metabarcoding tutorial
This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding about what galaxy is and why we use it. And you need to have an [activated account](https://github.com/naturalis/naturalis-galaxy-tutorials/tree/master/Create%20account) and be able to [upload](https://github.com/naturalis/naturalis-galaxy-tutorials/tree/master/Upload%20files) files. The [example file](https://github.com/naturalis/naturalis-galaxy-tutorials/raw/master/Basic%20metabarcoding/example_files/bulk_samples.zip) that is used for this tutorial can you find in de example_files folder.

**Upload [bulk_samples.zip](https://github.com/naturalis/naturalis-galaxy-tutorials/raw/master/Basic%20metabarcoding/example_files/bulk_samples.zip)**
<br />
The first step is to upload the example file, make sure that before you click on the start button you have slected the file type "zip". If you dont know how to do that check out this [page](https://github.com/naturalis/naturalis-galaxy-tutorials/tree/master/Upload%20files)

**Merge the paired end reads**<br />
The first step is to merge the paird-ends, sometimes this is also called doing a paired-end assembly. In galaxy you do this with a tool called "Merge reads"(1). The most left panel is called the tool panel(2) and there you can find all the tools that you need. You can also search for tools by using "search tools" field(3).<br />
