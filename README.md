# Naturalis Galaxy Tutorial
A "how to" tutorial for the use of the Naturalis Galaxy pipeline

## Analysing a mixed amplicon dataset
This tutorial will show a step by step introduction of the Naturalis Galaxy pipeline. The tutorial will use an example dataset that was sequenced paired-end with the Illumina MiSeq. This dataset consist out of environmental air samples collected in Leiden. The dataset contains ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer region) sequences packaged in six .fastq files.
