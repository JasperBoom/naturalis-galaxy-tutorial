## Subset .gz.zip and Cutadapt

This very short instruction is written for a specific use case\
where a zip-archive of gzipped fastq files needs to subsetted\
into primer specific sets (R1, R2, etc), the primer has to be\
trimmed and the fastq output exported as .gz.zip again.

Import the zip-archive
![import_screenshot](https://github.com/naturalis/naturalis-galaxy-tutorials/blob/master/Manage%20zip%20and%20trim%20primer/01_import.jpg)

Display the contents of the archive with *Manage zip*
![display_content](https://github.com/naturalis/naturalis-galaxy-tutorials/blob/master/Manage%20zip%20and%20trim%20primer/%2002_display_content.jpg)
Create a subset (e.g. R1) with *Manage zip*
