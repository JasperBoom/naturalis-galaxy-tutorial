** Subset gz.zip and trim primer

This very short instruction is written for a specific use case\
where a zip-archive of gzipped fastq files needs to subsetted\
into primer specific sets (R1, R2, etc), the primer needs to be\
trimmed and the (gzipped) archive exported (again as zip) so it\
can be used outside of Galaxy.\
