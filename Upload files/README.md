Choose the files that you want to upload by dragging the files in to this window or click on the "Choose local file" button. You can select multiple files. In galaxy every file has a certain file type, default it will auto-detect the right type. Auto detection is not flawless, zip files will not be recognized. To change the file type you can open the dropdown menu and select the type of choice.
